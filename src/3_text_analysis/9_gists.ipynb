Obviously, there cannot be oue cultural policy suited to all countries;\\neach Member State determines its own cultural policy according to the cultural values,\\naims and choices it sets for itself.\\n It has been largely recognized that there is a need for exchange of information and experience\\n between countries as well as for cross-nationalinvestigations on specific themes,\\nresearch into concepts and methods, etc.\\n The aim of this series, therefore, is to contribute to the dissemination of information by\\npresenting both the findings of such studies and various national surveys illustrating\\nproblems, experiments and achievements in individual countries chosen as representative\\nof differing socioeconomic systems, regional areas and levels of development.\\n This text is the outcome of a round-table meeting organized by Unesco from 18 to 22\\nDecember 1967 in Monaco. It was attended by thirty-two participants from twenty-four\\ncountries who had been invited in their personal capacity as being responsible for cultural\\naction at the national level, specialists in the social and human sciences, creative artists or\\nrepresentatives of interested non-governmental organizations. The conclusions reached\\nand recommendations adopted by the meeting have been used as a basis for the Unesco\\nprogramme in the field concerned.\\n Contents\\n Introduction\\n 9\\n The idea of 'culturalpolicy'\\n 10\\n Evaluation of cultural needs\\nand development of long-term programmes\\n 12\\n Artistic creation\\n and the training of cultural agents\\n 16\\n The channels for cultural action\\n 25\\n Administrative and financial structures\\n 36\\n Conclusions\\n 48\\n List of participants\\n 50\\n Introduction\\nRapidly evolving new ways of life and information techniques make people more clearly\\naware of their needs in the cultural field. In a civilization which is dominated by technology\\n, cultural action has an increasing role to play, supplementingeducational work and\\nscientific effort by giving them an aim. Its function is to ensure that development\\nserves the mind. It is no longer enough for a few individuals to take steps to promote\\nexchanges between elite groups, or for specialists to appreciate mutually the wealth\\nand excellence of neighbouring civilizations.It is for all the people to have access to cultural\\nlife and an active share in it. Cultural development must now catch up on and keep in step\\nwith technological and scientific progress;it must gradually take its place in over-allpolicies\\nfor development, along with those for education and scientific activity.\\n 9\\n The idea\\n of 'culturalpolicy'\\nThe participants to the round-table meeting on cultural policies decided unanimously\\nagainst embarking on an attempt to define culture; the representative of the DirectorGeneral\\n had made a point of recalling that it was not the role of Unesco to define the cultural\\n policy of States. It was considered preferable: (a) that 'culturalpoky' should be taken\\nto mean the sum total of the conscious and deliberate usages, action or lack of action in a\\nsociety, aimed at meeting certain cultural needs through the optimum utilization of all the\\nphysical and human resources available to that society at a given time; (b) that certain criteria\\n for cultural development should be delbed, and that culture should be linked to the\\nfullilment of personality and to economic and social development.\\n It was recognized that economic and social development should go hand in hand with\\ncultural development; culture has a beneficial effect on the means of production available\\nand on m a n himself; every improvement in physical well-being helps to promote culture,\\nby freeing m a n from enslavement to physical obligations, and by giving him leisure for the\\nactivities of the mind. The march of economic progress is generally reflected in the cultural\\nsphere, and cultural activity stimulates economic Me. Emphasis was placed on the need to\\nintegrate science in culture,and to study the way in which culture evolves under the influence\\nof science and technology. Attention was also drawn to the fact that literacy programmes\\nand cultural development form an indivisible whole: it is the cultural advancement of the\\nwhole people that imparts force to the literacy movement.\\n Over the last twenty years or so, and more especially since 1960,an increasing number of\\ngovernments have set up departments of cultural affairs distinct from their departments of\\neducation. This trend reflects, on the one hand, a new phenomenon-sometimes referred to\\nas 'cultural development'-connected with improvements in school enrolments, communication\\n media, town planning and living standards and, on the other, the determination\\nof governments to take deliberate measures, on a national scale, to meet this new demand.\\nSeveral States have written into their basic laws the idea of making great cultural works\\naccessible to all sections of the population. This cannot, however, be left entirely to individual\\n initiative, hampered as it is by so many economic and psychological difficulties. It\\nmust be promoted by the public authorities, which have the necessary means for carrying\\nout such a tremendous task.\\n Each country has a Merent general concept of the action which public authorities should\\ntake in the cultural field, and of its justification and aims.Generally, it appeared that there\\nare four Werent approaches:\\n 10\\n The idea of 'cultural policy'\\n1. Cultural policy is integrated in general planning.\\n2. The State considers that it has a responsibility for culture deriving from the role it has\\n undertaken towards the nation, and that it is the duty of the State to replace private initiative\\n which is not always capable of carrying out this task successfuliy.\\n3. One should beware of centralization and of a predominant role for the State in the\\n direct management of cultural institutions,because of the danger of cultural action being\\n reduced to uniformity and lest the controversial element in art be neutralized;those who\\n support this approach prefer to limit State intervention to financial assistance, free from\\n any conditions.\\n4. In certain developing societies it is considered that cultural development is essential in\\n order to strengthen awareness of nationhood and thus facilitate the growth of an original\\n culture which wili meet both the deepest aspirations of the people and the requirements\\n of the modern world; State intervention is essential, since private action is stili clearly\\n inadequate.\\nIn any event, State intervention must not have a harmful effect on the freedom to create\\nand public passivity must be avoided at any price.\\n 11\\n Evaluation of cultural needs\\n and development\\n of long-termprogrammes\\n Desirability of a general description of cultural activiiy\\nIn working out a cultural policy it is necessary to evaluate needs and to know what exists\\nto meet them. In most countries very little is known concerning either of these aspects:\\npeople do not even know what methods can be used to discover the facts of cultural activity\\nand what are the needs of the public. Which members of the public are in fact reached?\\nWhat is provided? By what types of institutions? With what equipment? With what staff?\\nAt what cost? In each sector (creation, dissemination, training, conservation), what are\\nthe activities and expenditure of the State, local communities, voluntary associations,\\nindividuals?\\n Answering these questions means approachingcultural problems objectively.A philosophy\\nof culture is not a sufficient basis for action; the facts that we are trying to change must\\nbe exactly known. These are the facts which will tell us who is benefiting from cultura1\\naction (which frequently reaches only the cultured), what proportion of the public is not\\nin any way affected, and what impact the various means of action have. It is then realized\\nhow inadequate former practice is in regard to the new problems. It is more readily appreciated\\n that a cultural policy cannot be confined to patronage, even on a larger scale than\\nbefore. It becomes obvious that a cultural policy must be linked both with a policy for continuing\\n education and a policy for decentralization and regional development. It falls into\\nits proper place in the social and economic development of the nation.\\n Methods of description\\nIn some countries an economic model is used, which consists in taking over for cultura1\\nactivity the categories used in economic analysis. In fact, the application of the notions of\\nsupply and demand to the cultural sector might be productive of many useful results,making\\npossible a better knowledge of the public, its diversity and its requirements and a much\\ncloser analysis of existing structures. The same holds good when the categories of production\\n, distribution and consumption are applied: this brings out more clearly the points\\nto which the efforts of the public authorities can be directed with the best effect. Furthermore\\n, it makes it possible to combine the data of cultural development with those of economic\\n, social and educational development.It is necessary, however, not to neglect notions\\nof free choice and the claims of the mind.\\n 12\\n Cultural needs and long-term programmes\\n Latent needs\\nThe round table emphasized that a distinction should be made between cultural demand and\\ncultural needs, which may remain latent, without being expressed as a demand. Cultural\\nneeds are not a fact; they are discovered by sociological research, using as a basis certain\\ndata (e.g., the difference between the cultural models of two societies or two groups),\\nbearing in mind desirable and possible objectives. People can only desire something that\\nthey know of. In order to understand the cultural needs of a people one must bring it into\\ncontact with cultural facts recognized as such, or with innovations, and, by offering it a\\nchoice, induce it to indicate its preferences.If offered the possibility of entering into contact\\nwith different or new forms of culture, people will have a better understanding of them and\\ntake more interest in them. This is particularly important in the case of young people.\\n A n example of this kind of action was quoted: in Japan, at the time when a young\\npeople's arts theatre was set up to tour rural areas, an inquiry was made into the choice of\\nplays to be put on. The results showed that all the authorities consulted were unanimously\\nin favour of modern works, mostly dramas or operas, on the grounds that the traditional\\nnoh and bunraku works, whose rhythm is too slow, would not be understood by young\\npeople. It was nevertheless decided, as an experiment, to put on traditional plays in certain\\nplaces: they had considerable success, and a demand arose for them.\\n In the absence of suitable machinery, systematic methods for evaluating needs have not\\nyet been devised. Even apart from the conceptual problems arising in connexion with the\\nvery idea of 'culturalneed', the methods of investigation are unusual and unfamiliar. The\\nvarious approaches may be grouped under the following heads.\\n First,the study of behaviour patterns by analysis of time-budgets,the measurement of\\nattendance at institutions (the 'user-hour'concept), and expenditure accounting gives a\\nbetter idea of levels of activity and, more particularly,of the areas of inactivity,the 'cultural\\ndeserts'.By means of comparisons over time or between regions, needs can to some extent\\nbe estimated. One participant insisted on the usefulness of statistics for research directed\\ntowards the future. Tables giving, for example, the number of theatres, cinemas, clubs,\\nsporting facilities, and the number of radio and television sets are helpful in foreseeing the\\nprobable evolution of cultural life. Another participant noted that it was not enough to draw\\ninferences; one must study changes in trends, their possible causes, and the means available\\n to bring them about.\\n Secondly, studies of behaviour patterns must be carried out by specialized institutes,using\\nthe appropriate statistical and sociological tools.Opinion polls do not give a really accurate\\npicture of the desiderata, for the samples interviewed speak only of what they know,\\nemploying the usual cliches. O n the other hand, opinion polls do provide a means of\\nevaluating the response to a particular offer and, thereby, of estimating the needs.\\n A third source of information is afforded by cultural promoters and persons responsible\\nfor cultural action in the field. The 'inspectors'of cultural action inquire into their needs\\nand pass the information on to the central administration. A fourth source is provided by\\nlocal council members or members of parliament, who are responsible for representing\\nregional or sectional interests.\\n In several countries, it has been felt that some co-ordinatingbody is required to evaluate\\nneeds. Research departments have been set up in the civil service, generally reporting to a\\nminister; their role is not to conduct studies themselves, but to commission specialized\\nbodies to carry them out. These departments draw up research programmes, follow their\\nimplementation, and see that they are turned to account by the various services. They\\nbuild up documentation,and redistributeinformation.In Czechoslovakia,a scientificcouncil\\n 13\\n Culrural needs and long-term Programmes\\nfor cultural development, reporting to the minister, has a membership of leading figures\\nin the world of the arts and scientific research workers. In other countries, commissions of\\ninquiry are set up for a certain length of time to study needs and propose solutions. In\\nSweden, a commission of inquiry on the decentralization of music gave rise both to a wideranging\\n sociological study on musical activity and to controlled practical experiments:\\nby combining the results of the two approaches, the commission is in a position to propose\\na reform of the organization of music.\\n Development of long-term programmes\\nMost participants pointed to the difficulties which arise at present in the development of\\nlong-term programmes. Cultural needs are evolving more quickly; new needs are appearing\\n, and public taste changes.As television sets have multiplied, for example, cinema attendances\\n have failen 50-70 per cent over a period of ten to fifteen years. One must, therefore,\\navoid choosing a framework which may become too narrow, and preserve the possibility\\nof a flexible adaptation of resources to the requirements of a rapidly evolving cultural\\nscene. Some countries have preferred to restrict themselvesto short-term plans (five or even\\nfour years), which makes possible periodic evaluations and the drawing of conclusions from\\nexperience. It is extremely difficult to carry out a study of methods in this field, since\\nadequate data are lacking.\\n In some countries, guidance panels are concerned with the establishment of long-term\\nprogrammes. Consisting of experts drawn not only from the administrationand from cultural\\n circles, but also from economic circles,these panels study long-term projections concerning\\n national trends (population, economic, educational and technological projections)\\nand try to situate the probable trend of cultural development against that background.\\n In the U.S.S.R.,a plan for cultural policy over the next twenty years provides for a widespread\\n development of cultural media and an increase in and improvement of the physical\\nand technical bases of culture, together with social measures aimed at facilitating participation\\n by the people in cultural activities.\\n During the last five years, an attempt has been made in Poland to draw up a long-term\\ncultural programme. From the institutional point of view, this is being carried out in the\\nframework of activities of the main national scientific organization, the Polish Academy\\nof Sciences.The Department of Social Sciences of the academy has set up a sector for research\\non contemporary culture responsible for working out a scientific basis for planning in the\\nfield of culture and its development. The Ministry for Culture and the Arts has a Council\\nfor Culture composed of distinguished representatives of art, science and culture. One of\\nthe tasks of the council is to assist the ministry in drawing up long-term plans. The firm\\nbelief that any set line of policy, in particular cultural policy,may easily become authoritarian\\n and runs the risk of embarking on utopian schemes is a decisive element in the growing\\nimportance attached to the necessity for scientific analyses as a condition of effective action.\\n The long-term economic development plan and demographic projections provide the\\nessential starting point for long-term cultural planning. Reference should be made to two\\nof the cultural problems which arise in demographic planning: the vital problem of cultural\\nrelations between different generations,which will live together for a longer time than formerly\\n (differing not only in age and in their background of historic experience but also,\\nthanks to educational advance, in their general level of education); and the problem of\\nculture for older people in an environment where most of the ideas in wide circulation are\\naimed at the young. The work of Polish specialists and planners in the field of culture is at\\npresent directed toward developing 'culturalmodels' for the future. These models will serve\\n 14\\n Cultural needs and long-term programmes\\nboth as an instrument for intellectual analysis and as a standardizing agent, determining\\nthe choice of a policy whereby set objectives may be reached. They are drawn up on the\\nbasis of three assumptions: (a) extrapolation from a series of statistics typical of the cultural\\nneeds of a society; (b) analogy with the cultural development of other countries, bearing in\\nmind differences in their socio-poiiticalsystems; and (c) a relative stabilization of certain\\nexisting structures and factors in the life of a nation.\\n Even those responsiblefor this exercise nevertheless recognize that it is extremely difficult;\\nand they point out that there are disadvantages in institutionalizing cultural activities.\\n 15\\n Artistic creation\\n and the training of cultural agents\\n Art and life\\n Traditional cultures\\nIn pre-industrial societies, art was closely linked with life. One participant even observed\\nthat in Africa the word 'art'has no meaning: objects which today are described as artistic\\nwere used as necessities of everyday life; dances and songs were not inspired by aesthetic\\npreoccupations. There was not one culture for the rich and one for the poor: culture was\\nindivisible, the common property of the tribe. Western civilization has also gone through\\nperiods when the position was much the same: the master builders of the cathedrals in\\nthe Middle Ages were anonymous, and their work had a social role.\\n The idea of 'art for the chosen few' should be discarded. Culture is born of the people,\\nfor the reason that it is fed by the deep well-springsof a people's conscience. A discussion\\ntook place on the extent to which, in modern society, work promotes cultural training or,\\non the contrary, hinders it.\\n For each culture, one must seek out the secrets of its life, growth and subsequent development\\n. The 'traditionalarts' should not be considered as poor relations, or minor arts whose\\nproducts should be buried in museums or commercialized for tourists.3he developing\\ncountries emphasize that it is important for them, 'firstly,to retrace and make widely known\\nthe values of their national cultures, and secondly, to take over the cultural heritage of\\nmankind in order to find a place in the world of today and to be able in their turn to\\nenrich the universal heritage by new creations which, from the artistic point of view, may\\nbe worthy of their era'.\\n One participant pointed out that in Japan the national culture has co-existed for a hundred\\nyears with Western culture and that the two have so closely intermingled that it is now\\noften difficult to define what is meant by 'traditional'art forms and 'modern'art forms;\\nthe distinctions between the art of the governing class and folk culture, and between creative\\nartists and the public, are virtually non-existent.\\n Various examples were quoted of the vitality of the 'traditional'arts; of efforts made\\nto revive them and breathe new life into them; and of the results obtained.\\n In Tunisia, one of the main objectives of cultural centres and committees is to contribute\\nin the first place to the revival of national culture; in each gouvernorat persons responsible\\nfor culture are invited to participate in the revival of local folklore and to take an interest\\n 16\\n Artistic creation and the training of cultural agents\\nin archaeology, folk poetry, and traditional music. The research carried out with regard\\nto traditional Tunisian music (Mulouf)has proved particularly useful, since the old airs\\nwere not notated. There is an urgent need to make a collection of them before those who\\npass them on orally die. Local cultural committees have the task of tracing Malouf singers,\\nrecording the tunes of the different regions and arousing interest in them among young\\nTunisian men and women.\\n In Colombia, Ecuador and above all in Mexico and certain areas of Brazil, displays of\\nfolk culture are both numerous and lively. Fiestas are truly popular, and real talent is used\\nin the arts of costume, dance and music. Some of them, however, have acquired a modern\\naspect in the sense that they are an ainrmation of conscious nationhood. They are often\\nexpanded into festivals organized by the authorities for public or political celebrations.\\n In Guinea, a particularly original creation is the instrumental and choral ensemble of\\nthe national broadcasting company, which uses only the traditional musical instruments\\nof the country. It has undertaken the task of harmonizing and orchestrating, and bringing\\nback into favour, the old songs and epics which recount the glorious destiny of national\\nheroes. A visible sign of the development of the music of the country is the existence of three\\norchestras, the records of whose musical creations are widely known both in Africa and\\nbeyond.\\n New art forms\\nM o d e m mass media can usefully help in reviving traditional arts. They should not, however\\n, be considered solely as methods for spreading the arts, since they bear in themselvesthe\\nseed of new art forms.The real masterpieces produced so far by the cinema in half a century,\\nwhich have raised the cinema to an art, and the results of experiments and research in broadcasting\\n and television, are rich in promise; they are already producing an effecton other\\nfields of artistic creation which can only become more pronounced. In particular, broadcasting\\n and television may perhaps make possible a direct transition from a traditional oral\\nculture to a new oral culture.The problem for them is to evolve a form of expression of their\\nown. Only in this way will it be possible, in the words of one participant, to 'disinfect the\\nmass media, which now threaten to corrupt civilization'.\\n The aesthetic element in everyday life\\nIn many countries an effort is now being made to improve the surroundings in which m a n\\nlives his life, and to raise the level of each day's cultural content. This brings us to the heart\\nof the matter: the aesthetic element in everyday life; a problem in which architecture, townplanning\\n and industriai design are all involved. Our surroundings, and everyday objects,\\nshould not be merely functionai; beauty of form and usefulness should be inseparable.\\n Modern techniques, new construction materials, and new forms of decoration make\\narchitectural innovations possible. Little is done, or known, about interesting, informing\\nand training the public, or even builders themselves. Exhibitions of models and 'briefing\\nmeetings' are organized in some countries, and a number of countries are taking an interest\\nin the question and studying various solutions. In the U.S.S.R.,for example, voluntary art\\ncouncils settle a variety of problems concerning town planning and the modernization of\\nthe appearance of streets, squares and shop windows, and thus try to contribute towards\\nthe art education of the peopIe. Such concerns need to be more clearly reflected in cultural\\npolicy.\\n 17\\n Artistic creation and the training of cultural agents\\n Assistance to artisuc creation\\nIn the past, princes made a practice of commissioning artists to work for them, either to\\nadd glory to their reigns or for their own pleasure. In m o d e m democracies, it is gradually\\ncoming to be felt that a society's greatness in the eyes of the world and in the history of\\nmankind owes much to the form and quality of the works of art it produces.\\n It is not enough to acquaint people with the vast store of treasures inherited from the past;\\nwe must foster the spring of creation itself,for it is that which gives the new society symbolic\\nimages of its own distinctive identity and the wealth of values it embodies. Creation is the\\nprincipie of life in cultural activity. Socially speaking, artists have always been-and often\\nstill are, even in the 'welfare societies'-among the most underprivileged members of the\\ncommunity.Their income is low and irregular.They do not enjoy the protection afforded by\\nmembership of the great organizations of modern society. It is therefore now generally\\nagreed that governmental authorities should take a hand UI the situation.At present, assistance\\n to artistic creation is most often directed towards group media (cinema and theatre)\\nrather than to individual creative artists.\\n What are the most effective procedures for assisting artistic creation? The methods adopted\\nshould be such as to meet the major requirement for artistic creation: the freedom of the\\nartist. Whatever the method adopted, therefore, the basic problem to be solved is how to\\nsecure the freedom of the creative artist,while at the same time giving him the place he should\\nhave in economic and social life.\\n Whatever is done to assist artistic creation should be based on indisputable facts. Some\\nstudies have already been made, although much stili remains to be done. The foliowing\\nare examples of work in this sphere: the survey on the professional and social position of\\nartists carried out in 1957 by the InternationalAssociation of Art and published under the\\ntitle, Definition of the Professional Artist; in the United Kingdom, a Short Survey of the\\nSituation of the Artist in England: Visual Arts (1960),published by the Congressfor Cultural\\nFreedom, and The Book Writers- W h o Are They? (1966), compiled by Richard Findlater\\non the basis of a survey conducted by Research Services Ltd.; in France, Enquete sur les\\nDebouches de l'Enseignement Artistique (1967); the United Arab Republic has set up a\\nnational council to be responsible for examining the situation as regards artistic creation in\\nthe repubiic and how it can be encouraged;and in 1967, Sweden started a systematic survey\\non creative artists, their numbers and their income, as compared with other categories of\\ncitizens. In the U.S.S.R.,a socio-psychological inquiry on creativity in the arts has been\\ncarried out with the help of a cultural periodical.\\n Legal assistance\\nIt appears that governments, as Weil as artists' unions in the different countries,are concerned\\n with legal assistance,but the nature of the action taken or to be taken naturally depends\\nupon the laws and regulationsin force in each country, which may vary very widely. Another\\npoint on which it would be useful to have information is what changes have been made by\\ncertain countries in copyright law. The artist also sometimes has a droit de suite in respect\\nof his works. In general, however, the national studies make no mention of action in this\\nsphere.\\n Social assistance\\nIt is desirable to separate social assistance from assistance to artists, since, in the past, as\\nartists were frequently in straitened circumstances, the public authorities often used to commission\\n work from them for social rather than aesthetic considerations.H o w many pictures\\n 18\\n Artistic creation and the training of cultural agents\\nand sculptures are cluttering the cellars of ministries-and were not fit to be displayed even\\nwhen they were delivered !Such a policy meant that the funds available were frittered away,\\nwith very dubious criteria for their allocation and little significance for culture.\\n A sounder procedure would be to define and apply social assistance measures applicable\\nto all artists who satisfy certain professional criteria. It is desirable that such social measures\\n should be the responsibility of a separate administration, and that those who are\\nresponsible for cultural action and the commissioning of works by the State should not have\\ntheir hands tied by social considerations. In some countries, for example, grants from\\n'culturalfunds'are made to artists and their families in case of need. Another country has\\nrecently adopted a system of insurance for painters, sculptors and engravers, covering sickness\\n, maternity benefits and death.\\n Tax relief\\nMany countries allow tax relief not for artists but for the distributors in various sectors.\\nThe problem of a policy for the partial or even complete exemption from taxation of artists\\nthemselves has been raised by many artists' unions, societies of authors and so on. In the\\nUnited Kingdom, for instance, copyright sale is still treated as income, and taxed as such.\\nSome relaxation has, however, been allowed in the possibility of spreading the tax payable\\non royalties and other sums received over a period of two years. Here, too,artists, generally\\nbenefit indirectly from measures providing tax relief for foundations and associations. Reductions\\n in taxation, and credit facilities, are sometimes allowed-usually under recent\\nlegislation-to distributors in the cinema and theatre sectors. Many countries give direct\\nassistance.In Mexico, for instance, artists are allowed to settle their tax claims by handing\\nover their works to the State.\\n Prizes,commissions and other forms of State assistance\\nThe award of prizes and State commissions,which was for a long time largely a matter of\\nwhich artists the authorities happened to know, should also form part of the cultural action\\npolicy and be governed by a policy-or, in other words, by principles of action and administration\\n. If contact is to be re-established between the sovereign-nowadays, the peopleand\\n the artist,so that the latter may be conscious of a demand from society, the first necessity\\n is to link commissioning with the distribution system.\\n Public buildings\\nPublic buildings provide the most obvious opportunity for State-commissioned work,\\neither in architecturai design or in the related arts. In the United States of America 0.5\\nper cent of the cost of public buildings may be used for their decoration by artists. In\\nFrance, 1 per cent of the cost of school buildings may likewise be set aside for such decoration\\n. In Tunisia, the sums allocated for the decoration of public buildings may amount\\nto as much as 1 per cent of the cost of the construction work. In Sweden, an allocation of\\n2 million kronor was included in the 1967-68 budget for the purchase of works of art to\\ndecorate public buildings.\\n The problem is: (a) to induce architects to make use of these facilities (in France, 4 per\\ncent of the 1 per cent is paid to the architect to cover his costs); (b) to help the architect in\\nchoosing works of art, especially when he lives at a distance from the main centres of artistic\\n creation. Documentation centres are at present being set up for the assistance of\\n 19\\n Artistic creation and the training of cultural agents\\narchitectsand to secure the harmonious integration of the different forms of expression.The\\nlatest trend is to bring artists into the picture as soon as the preparation of the plans begins,\\nso that their works are not added as an after-thought or superimposed,as mere ornamentation\\n, but form an integral and vital part of the architectural composition.\\n Exhibitions\\nWorks commissioned by the State should not be left mouldering 'in store', nor should they\\nmerely adorn the buildings occupied by public authorities; they should be exhibited to the\\ngeneral public. Temporary exhibitions might be organized, to tour various cultural centres\\nand museums.\\n Performance of musical works\\nIf a work is commissioned but not performed,the composer may benefit,but cultural action\\nas such is not furthered at all. Systems are now being devised whereby commissioning is\\nlinked to performances; either the State commissions the work directly and guarantees\\nthat it will be performed, or-preferably-orchestras themselves are asked to commission\\nmusical works from composers chosen by them, and receive grants from the political\\nauthorities for that purpose. In some countries,grants are made to cover the cost of copying\\nthe score.\\n Hire-purchase of works of arts\\nCertain cultural centres have devised a system whereby contemporary works, chosen by\\nthe centre, can be hired out to private persons for a nominal sum-about the amount it\\ncosts to insure the work. If the borrower likes a work, he may purchase it.\\n Experimentation\\nAn artist's production may not immediately find a place in social life. The history of progressive\\n art movements abounds in examples of works which were not understood until\\nmany years later. Yet research and experimentation are even more vital in art than in any\\nother sphere. Experimental art must be assisted by the authorities; works commissioned\\nby the State may thus not all have a place in the distribution system;some commissionsmay\\nrepresent assistance to basic research in the visual arts. Some countries earmark funds for\\nthis purpose in the same way as they do for basic scientific research, and sometimes through\\nthe same machinery.\\n Grants and allowances\\nAlmost all countries make grants and allowances available to artists and writers. The financial\\n aspect apart,the questionis: at what stage in their career and for how long? Then again,\\nare these rewards to go to established artists and writers or to beginners? Formerly subsidies\\nwent to the older generation, who became official poets or painters. The modern trend\\nseems to be to encourage new talent on a larger scale by means of limited assistance (at least\\ntwo years but not more than five) rather than to 'institutionalize'a few established careers.\\n 20\\n Artistic creation and the training of cultural agents\\n Experimental studios (for contacts between creative artists\\n and between these artists and the public)\\nThe round table considered there was an urgent need to provide research premises and studios\\n for experiments in the arts (the theatre,cinema,painting, etc.) on the same lines as laboratories\\n where scientists, singly or in teams, and often from different disciplines, enjoy\\nfreedom of creation.Such studios,whether national,regional or international,where artists\\ncan meet and experiment,would bring about some of the conditions considered favourable\\nfor creation in the modern world.\\n The three following courses of action seemed to be the most effective:\\n1. Contacts between artists and craftsmen using traditional forms of expression : poets,\\n novelists, writers, painters, sculptors, architects, dramatists, actors, musicians, choreographers\\n.\\n2. Contacts and comparisons between these and specialists in modern techniques of expression\\n or dissemination: film,television,radio, sound or photographic recording.\\n3. Contacts between these artists and craftsmen,working alone or in teams,and the community\\n, Le., with as diversified a public as possible, ranging from a public assumed to be receptive\\n to new forms to audiences for which this type of experiment is a complete novelty.\\n Such contacts should include experiments in collective creation, grouping artists among\\n themselves,and also grouping artists and the public.\\nArchitecture has a major role to play here, since the question will arise of the forms to be\\ngiven to these experimentalcentres,which will be a hive of cells opening into each other and\\nmaking possible interactions and an exchange of influences between the different art forms.\\n In the field of literature,contacts between writers, poets and novelists would be encouraged\\n by the organization of meetings at the national, regional or international level which\\nwould be extended to a dialogue with the public, using modern media-broadcasting and,\\nabove all, television.\\n Management machinery\\nThe selection of commissioned works and the allocation of grants pose delicate problems of\\ncultural policy, for they involve personal taste. W h o is to select, and according to what\\ncriteria?\\n Selection by civil servants is open to criticism on the grounds that extraneous considerations\\n enter into it or else that it is too subjective.Anxiety to be impartial and the guarantee\\nrequired by public authorities generally lead to the settingup of commissions,which have two\\ninherent defects: their members, even if they are artists,cannot be appointed otherwise than\\non the basis of recognized qualifications-they are therefore,notabilities-and, furthermore,\\nthe decisions are majority decisions. The 'average'choice therefore prevails. N o w creative\\nart is generally extreme and refutes established canons. Furthermore, if the commission,in\\nan endeavour to be independent, renews its membership by co-opting,it only perpetuates its\\noriginaltendencies and underestimatesany art which challengesit; in other words,it becomes\\nacademic. At all events, art which breaks new ground is not appreciated. T o avoid this risk,\\nselection can be left in the hands of responsible individuals,who are free to make decisions\\nquite independently of the authorities,but it should not be left in the same hands too long.\\n Patronage by firms\\nT o safeguard aesthetic diversity and the freedom of the creative artist to innovate, it is\\nWeil that aid should come from various sources.Private patrons can take risks which public\\nauthorities cannot take. Furthermore,in modern countries, financial power (apart from the\\n 21\\n Artistic creation and the training of cultural agents\\nState and the mass of consumers) is vested mainly in firms. So in some countries they have\\nbeen approached to aid artistic creation. They grant this aid either by commissioning works\\nto decorate their headquarters or factories, or by organizing exhibitions on their premises.\\nIn some countries firms have, in addition to their economic functions,a cultural function:\\nPolish legislation, for instance, makes this compulsory.\\n Patronage by trade unions\\nWhether patronage is compulsory or whether experiments are made on an optional basis with\\na few trade unions, the aim is always to bring the creative artist and the worker closer together\\n. This is done,for example, by providing studios for artists on factory premises. In certain\\n countries, trade unions make grants to a substantial number of creative artists. It would\\nseem, however, that this form of patronage is still not very common in most countries with\\nliberal economies,attempts being hampered by certain reservations on the part of the trade\\nunions.\\n Foundations\\nIn countries where private fortunes can be built up, foundations have been valuable in\\nfostering patronage. In the United States of America, for example, many aspects of national\\n development have always benefited considerably by private funds. Provisions governing\\nprobate duty, and then taxation on private income, granting partial exemption for amounts\\ndonated to charitable institutions,have led to the growth of vast foundations. United States\\nfoundations today devote from 3 to 4 per cent of their resources to the arts, and this amount\\ncorresponds to 80 per cent of all public support. The foundations do not assist continuing\\nactivities so much as particular projects or projects which will subsequently be taken over\\nby the public authorities. They undertake what the State cannot yet do and are a factor\\npromoting innovation. However, although they have their advantages, they have corresponding\\n disadvantages: dispersal of their efforts, lack of a long-term programme, lack of\\nspecific competence.Therefore,if they are to be effective agents for the promotion of cultural\\naction, they too must be associated with a general cultural policy.\\n Training\\n Professional art training\\nArt education has a long tradition behind it and so presents problems of adaptation. In\\nmany countries, there has been a rapid increase in the number of students at specialized\\ninstitutions-academies of art, music and the like-which has brought with it serious\\nemployment problems for those in charge of cultural policy. The point is to balance the\\nsupply and the demand: how can a plethora of artists in sectors offering relatively poor\\noutlets, such as the visual arts, be avoided? One method, adopted by Poland, consists in\\npromoting the development of institutes of applied art, for which there is a constantly growing\\n industrial demand. The same problem also arises in connexion with music, where one\\nfairly satisfactory medium-term solution can be the reorganization of training facilities to\\ndistinguish more clearly between the training of amateurs and that of professionals. Some\\ncountries pay particular attention to the provision of institutions for the purpose of training\\nspecialists in the performing arts (theatre, cinema, radio, television).\\n The development of technical media (photographic equipment, cinematographic, projec22\\n Artistic creation and the training of cultural agents\\ntion and recording equipment,etc.) and their mass production, which makes them accessible\\nto a large section of the public, make possible the discovery of artistic vocations and of a\\ngrowing amount of talent. Thus the distinction between professionals and amateurs is gradually\\n disappearing, and the recruitment of specialists continues over an ever-widening\\nfield.\\n Training of arts administrators\\nChanges in the function of the traditional means of spreading culture and the emergence of\\nnew agencies-mass communication media, adult education movements, social and cultural\\nfacilities-have brought with them for all countries the problems of running the institutions\\ninvolved and, at all levels, problems of manpower, whether the people required be arts\\nadministrators,adult education organizers, or those in charge of cultural centres. Regular,\\norganized cultural action on the part of government and local communities is something\\nquite new; and like the other sectors,it calls for competent administrators. Similarly,in the\\ngreat private institutions (symphony orchestras, theatres, etc.) administrative work has\\nbecome so complicated as to rule out the amateurism which hitherto prevailed. Most countries\\n are today feeling their way towards solutions on a trial-and-errorbasis. The alternatives\\n are either to provide training in cultural affairs for young graduates of schools of\\nadministration, or to give artists, writers, etc., courses in administration.\\n The participants considered that, in most countries, highly responsible posts in the field\\nof cultural affairs are only too often held either by artists without any administrativeability\\nor even inclination,or else, on the contrary, by civil servants who are entirely unaware of the\\nparticular problems facing artists and those who promote cultural activities.Thus the training\\n of those who hold these offices constitutes a problem of great importance, which might\\nperhaps be solved in two ways: by the creation of training centres for groups of countries\\nwhose civilization and governmental structures are to a certain extent similar;and by setting\\nup training courses in existing institutions,for example in universities, specialized institutes\\nof higher learning, colleges of social or human sciences.\\n Under certain conditions these centres or courses might also be used to train 'cultural\\nactivities promoters' or even technicians(for example, broadcasting or television producers\\nor directors).\\n Training of cuiturai activities promoters (animateurs culturels)\\nThe promoter is an educator, either professional or voluntary, whose aim is to persuade\\npeople to participate of their own will in activities which are not the standard ones of\\ntheir environment. H e bridges the gap between creative artists and the public, and between\\nworks of art and the ordinary man. Studies of the qualificationsrequired in such promotional\\nstaff are now being made (Czechoslovakia,Poland, France) and will enable us to specify\\nexactly what should be their level ofrecruitment,thenature of their training,the type of career\\noffered and their status.\\n Several countries, however, consider that multi-function teachers of this sort should be\\nuniversity-trained.Others prefer specialized training institutions suited to the specific pioneering\\n character of cultural activities organization. Some institutions have a country-wide\\ncoverage (United Kingdom, France, Tunisia), the aim being to secure consistency,efficiency\\nand optimum utilization. O n the other hand, training may be left to local or sector institutions\\n (museums, libraries, cultural centres), making decentralization possible and a better\\nresponse to regional or sector needs, as well as the employment of local talent. The current\\n 23\\n Artistic creation and the training of cultural agents\\ntendency is to mix the two combining a common core of theory with specialized field courses\\nfor each sector.\\n Whether the subject of recent research,as in Italy,the United Kingdom, France and the\\nUnited States of America, or determined by older practices, as in the countries of Eastern\\nEurope, the training programmes for cultural activities promoters are everywhere being\\nre-examined.What theoretical studies are desirable (sociology, psychology, education, art\\nappreciation)? What practical work should be included, how long should this last, when\\nand where should it be done? One participant pointed out that the non-governmental\\norganizations' Working Party on the Role of Culture in Leisure had carried out a tentative\\ninquiry among its members regarding the training of personnel of this kind.\\n Training of audio-visual technicians\\nSeveral developing countriesstress the need for training specialistsin audio-visualtechniques,\\nwhich are particularly important among peoplesin the course of becoming literate and\\nlacking the traditional cultural amenities.\\n Training of technicians for the protcction of sites and monuments\\nIn many countries there are not yet enough qualified local curators to look after the archaeological\\n treasures of the country. International co-operation,highly effective though it already\\n is, is no substitute for regular local supervision, which international experts cannot\\nundertake. Hitherto,national technicianshave received their training while working alongside\\n these experts, but the shortcomings of this method and the scale of needs make other\\nmeasures necessary.\\n Training of museum specialists\\nA cultural action policy calls for museums which are no longer merely repositories but go\\nout to instruct the public. The role of the museum curator is, therefore, changing: he must\\nstill be a scholar who builds up the collections, classifies them and preserves them, but at\\nthe same time he must also be a display artist,a promoter,for museum management is changing\\n and now makes use of audio-visual equipment and provides amenities to attract the\\npublic. This calls for specialized training (through theoreticaland practical courses), the features\\n of which could be better defined by means of international discussions.Unesco has\\nalready begun to act in this field,with the assistance of the InternationalCouncil of Museums.\\n Training of librarians\\nSimilarly, a librarian is no longer merely a keeper who adds to and classifies his collections;\\nhe must now ensure that the great works published (in the form of books, records or tapes)\\nreach the widest possible audience. Public reading depends to a large extent upon his promotional\\n abilities (in one city, the number of volumes loaned annually increased fourfold\\nwhen the library was 'livenedup'). Straight librarianship is thus no longer the only technique\\nin which the future librarian must be trained: he must also be familiar with methods of\\npromoting activities,readership identification and cultural action. In some countries, librarians\\n are required to attend courses in cultural activities promotion, whereas, in others,\\n an initial general training in the promotion of such activities is followed by one year of\\nspecialization in librarianship.\\n 24\\n The channels for cultural action\\n New data\\nInstitutions for the spread of culture are undergoing a radical transformation due partly to\\ntechnical advances in methods of communicating culture and partly to the expansion of\\naudiences and profound changes in their way of life. Over and above the part they can and\\nshould play in creating new art forms, mass communication media provide for greater\\naccess to culture than traditional institutions such as theatres, museums and libraries. In\\nFrance, for example, a hundred times more people go to the cinema than to the theatre\\nand the hours spent \", {'filename': '001173engo.txt', 'n_chars': 111444, 'local_number': 1173, 'n_tokens': 23142, 'lang': 'en', 'n_pages_cat': '46', 'n_chars_cat': '<1MB', 'n_pages': 46, 'n_bytes': 142843, 'n_words': 20074, 'year': 1969, 'document_id': 1173})\n"
