I give you a very warm welcome and I wish that every time you enter this house you may feel at home. We have only welcome and respect for you and for your peoples and the Heads of your governments. I greet you all and I wish you a fruitful endeavour, and a prolific endeavour. The work of an ambassador is a labour of small steps, of small things, but one whose end is always for peace, bringing the hearts of peoples closer together, sowing brotherhood among nations. And this is your task, but through the small things, very small. And today we are all glad that we have seen how two nations, who were alienated from one another for many years, yesterday made a step of coming closer together. Now, this was brought about by ambassadors, by diplomacy. Your work is noble, very noble. I wish for you that it be rich and fruitful and that God bless you. Thank you!
