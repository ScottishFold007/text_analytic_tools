Once elected to the See of Rome I had the opportunity to ponder on this subject often and concluded that such a project would be of considerable help in carrying out the pastoral ministry of the Successor of Peter which my brother Cardinals wished to entrust to me.  
For this reason on last 13 April I announced the institution of the above-mentioned group, and at the same time gave the names of those who were called to belong to it. Now, after long reflection, I deem it appropriate that this group be established by this Chirograph as a “Council of Cardinals” with the task of assisting me in the governance of the universal Church and of studying a project for the revision of the Apostolic Constitution

 on the Roman Curia. It will be made up of the same people mentioned above who from time to time, as a Council or individually, will be asked about issues that I consider worthy of attention. As regards the composition of the Council, I reserve the right to make the appointments for the best result. The said Council will be a further expression of episcopal communion and assistance to the 
munus petrinum 
which the Episcopate across the world is able to offer.
