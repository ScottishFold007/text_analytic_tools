I am grateful to the Congregation for Catholic Education for the initiatives it has taken in the 50th year of the Declaration 
 
 Gravissimum Educationis
 on Christian education, promulgated by the 
 Second Vatican Ecumenical Council
 on 28 October 1965.
I am also pleased to learn that the same Dicastery has decided to constitute in this circumstance a Foundation called 
Gravissimum Educationis
 intended to further scientific and cultural objectives aimed at promoting Catholic education in the world” (
Statutes
). 
The Church recognizes that “the paramount importance of education in the life of men and its ever- growing influence on the social progress of the age” are profoundly linked to the fulfillment of “the mandate she received from her divine founder to announce the mystery of salvation to all men and to renew all things in Christ” (
GE
, Preface).
I gladly grant, therefore, the request I received to establish in Vatican City State the
 Gravissimum Educationis
 Foundation.
In virtue of the apostolic authority in the Church and of the sovereignty of Vatican City State, provided for by can. nn. 116 § 1, 117 and 1303 § 1, of the Code of Canon Law,
I hereby 
in public canonical juridical person and in civil juridical person the 
Gravissimum Educationis
 Foundation, with its headquarters in Vatican City.
The Foundation shall be governed by the canon laws in force in the Church and by the civil laws in force in Vatican City as well as by the Statutes attached hereto.
Vatican City, 28 October 2015
