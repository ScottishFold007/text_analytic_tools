I desire to express my heartfelt participation in the mourning of the relatives and the Capitalâ€™s entire Jewish community on the passing of Rabbi Elio Toaff, distinguished spiritual leader of the Jews in Rome.
As a protagonist in Jewish history and Italian society in recent decades, he was able to gain mutual respect and appreciation for his moral authority, in addition to his profound humanity.
I recall with gratitude his generous commitment and sincere willingness to promote dialogue and fraternal relations between Jews and Catholics, who witnessed a significant moment during his memorable meeting with St John Paul II at the Synagogue of Rome.
I raise prayers to the Most High, rich in love and faithfulness, that He may welcome him into His Kingdom of peace.
From the Vatican, 20 April 2015
